# DP1 Auction Website
This website was made as a small (less than 3 weeks, one person only) project for the Distributed Programming class at the Politecnico di Torino, during the first year of my MSc. The only purpose of this project is to emulate an auction website for didactic purposes. Most of the focus was given to security issues, to avoid a possible attacker to break the backend by crafting unexpected requests.
            
The frontend uses HTML5 and CSS3 for the markup, and <b>JQuery</b> to perform asynchronous requests and improve the user experience by client validation.
The backend is based on <b>PHP</b>, with the support of a <b>MySQL</b> database.
            
There is no TLS connection due to some problem with the hosting on Altervista.
